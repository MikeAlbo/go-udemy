In West Philly I was born and raised,
on a playground, is where I spent most of my day, 
chilling out max and relaxing all cool, 
I was shooting some b-ball outside of a school,
when a couple of guys who were up to no go, 
started making trouble in my neighborhood,
I got in one little fight and my mom got scared, 
she said your moving in with your Aunt and uncle in Bel-Aire.
